# Farming Simulator Linux Mod Manager
## About
FS-LMM is all about getting mods sourced from outside the GIANTS ModHub into
the game we all know and love.  Since Steam Proton has enabled many Linux
users to play the Farming Simulator titles, even if there may be a few issues,
the Linux community has been mostly excluded from easy, drag-and-drop modding
due to the directory structure of Proton-enabled games.
